            The internship included many responsibilities necessary to run a
            business. Each day brought different circumstances and I had the
            opportunity to make decisions on my own and learn from both my
            successes and failures. The internship was a worthwhile experience
            and I feel that it has prepared me well for my professional
            career. I will take both the positive and negative aspects of the
            internship with me in applying for and analyzing future
            opportunities.” Timothy Meehan Business Administration Student

            It was a wonderful opportunity to learn and get better
            understanding of the culture of the company. I also benefitted
            from attending the training programs and seminars and have enjoyed
            the friendship with my colleagues that was developed during my
            time working at Impero.

            I enjoyed my time at Impero: the tutor was very able to transfer
            information and fully willing to answer my questions, providing
            clear explanations. I was integrated within the group from the
            beginning, as my colleagues were helpful and friendly and I was
            actively involved in several activities and events organized by
            the company.

            I learned how to introduce myself, talk about my interests,
            knowledge and skills with entrepreneurs and business owners, as
            well as how to ask questions and gain a better understanding of
            businesses not only in the co-working space, but also others in
            the market.

            I applied for a marketing internship at Zig Zag Hub, which offers
            co-working spaces for young entrepreneurs doring the Internship. I
            knew this would be an excellent opportunity for me to meet
            different entrepreneurs in this tech community, learn about their
            businesses, observe how different businesses operate and expand my
            knowledge and network.

            From conducting comprehensive competitor analysis research, to
            designing a marketing and communication plan, my knowledge of
            business and marketing theories was transformed into a series of
            practical techniques and skills that I can now implement in
            real-life business scenarios, all thanks to my internship.
